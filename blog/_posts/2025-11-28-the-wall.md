We trained our first neural network.

93,164 professional games. Months of human wisdom compressed into gradients.

The loss curves looked beautiful.

The AI played like garbage.

## The Wall Problem

![Wall Problem]({{ '/images/wall-problem.png' | relative_url }})

Straight lines. Column after column.

No corners. No territory. Just... walls.

The network had learned to place stones.

It had not learned to *play Go*.

## What Went Wrong

Our feature planes:

| Plane | Description | Problem |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| 17-19 | Groups with 1/2/3 liberties | **SPARSE** |
| 20-22 | Opponent group liberties | **SPARSE** |
| 23 | Capture moves available | **VERY SPARSE** |
| 24 | Self-atari moves | **VERY SPARSE** |

Most positions have no captures. Most groups have 4+ liberties.

![Feature Sparsity]({{ '/images/feature-sparsity.png' | relative_url }})

The network saw mostly zeros.

It learned nothing from nothing.

## Policy Accuracy

Basic features (17 planes): **40%**

Tactical features (27 planes): **21%**

*Worse*. More features, less learning.

The signal drowned in noise.

---

## The Deeper Problem

With only win/loss as feedback, the network guesses.

Did we lose because of move 47? Or move 12?

Did the corner invasion fail because of reading? Or joseki?

One bit of information per game. Hundreds of decisions.

The credit assignment problem.

## Watching It Fail

```
Move 1:  D4   (corner - good)
Move 5:  E4   (next to own stone - weird)
Move 9:  F4   (straight line - wrong)
Move 13: G4   (wall continues - no)
Move 17: H4   (WHY)
```

It had learned that stones should be near other stones.

It had not learned *why*.

## The Question

How does KataGo train in 19 days what AlphaGo took 40?

What do they know that we don't?

Time to read some papers.

The wall taught us something.

Watching failure closely is the first step toward understanding.

Tomorrow we study the masters.
