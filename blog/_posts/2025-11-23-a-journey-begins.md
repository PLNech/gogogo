Before the first move, there is only potential.

The board lies empty. Not barren—pregnant with possibility.

Each intersection awaits its purpose.

## The Question

Can a machine learn to see?

Not just pattern-match. Not just brute-force search.

*See*.

The way a master sees shape. The way a student sees light.

---

## Why Go

Go is deceptively simple.

Two colors. One rule: surround to capture. A stone without [liberties]({{ '/glossary#liberty' | relative_url }}) is removed.

Yet from this simplicity emerges complexity that humbles.

It took decades for computers to play at amateur dan level. Then [AlphaGo]({{ '/glossary#alphago--alphazero' | relative_url }}) happened.

But AlphaGo had thousands of TPUs.

We have one RTX 4080.

## The Goal

Not to defeat humans at Go.

Not to build the strongest possible engine.

To *understand*.

To make visible what was hidden.

To become stronger by teaching machines to see.

## First Lines

```typescript
// Initial commit
npm create vite@latest gogogo -- --template react-ts
```

Hello, world.

The journey begins.

> 空即是色
> *Emptiness is form*

What does an empty board teach? Everything. The potential for all games lives in 361 intersections of nothing.

Today we wrote our first test. Tomorrow we teach capture.

One stone at a time.
