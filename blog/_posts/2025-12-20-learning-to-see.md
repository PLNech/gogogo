We built 1449 tests today.

Not clever tests. Not deep reading. Not life-and-death.

[Basic instincts](/glossary#basic-instincts):

```
CAPTURE — take what's yours       ESCAPE — save what's dying

    . ● .                             . ○ .
    ● ○ ★  ← fill last liberty        ○ ● ★  ← extend to breathe
    . ● .                             . ○ .
```

```
CONNECT — join your friends       CUT — divide your enemies

    ● . ★ . ●  ← link groups          ○ . ★ . ○  ← separate them
```

```
ATARI — threaten                  DEFEND — protect

    . ● .                             ● . ●
    ● ○ ★  ← reduce to 1 liberty      . ★ .  ← guard the cut
    . . .                             . ○ .
```

```
EXTEND — breathe                  BLOCK — deny

    . . .                             . ○ .
    ● ★ .  ← grow outward             . ★ .  ← stop expansion
    . . .                             . . .
```

Eight ways to see: [Capture](/glossary#capture), [Escape](/glossary#escape), [Connect](/glossary#connect), [Cut](/glossary#cut), [Atari](/glossary#atari), [Defend](/glossary#defend), [Extend](/glossary#extend), [Block](/glossary#block).

A child learns them in their first game.

---

Our model scored **1.3%**.

Zero on capture. Zero on escape. Zero on connect.

Worse than random.

Worse than a child.

There's a French song. *Le Déconservatoire* by [Les Voleurs de Swing](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Voleurs_de_swing).

The conservatory teaches rules. Scales. Theory. Discipline.

You lose freedom. You drill structure into bone.

It feels like death.

But only those who master the rules earn the right to break them.

Django learned technique. Then he forgot it. Then he played.

---

We wanted to teach our model *joseki*. *Fuseki*. The grand patterns.

Hubris.

It cannot see a stone in atari.

---

So we go back.

Eight instincts. Five board sizes. 1449 positions.

Corners. Edges. Center. Black to play. White to play.

The humblest curriculum.

---

Great artists steal.

But first, they copy.

Stroke by stroke. Stone by stone.

---

The beauty isn't in the rules.

It's in what comes after.

When the hand moves before thought.

When structure becomes style.

When we earn the right to unlearn.

---

But not yet.

First, we learn to see.

We are weak. We admit it.

Now we work.
