Terms from Go, AI, and the spaces between.

## Go Terms

**Atari** · A group with only one liberty remaining. One move from capture.
[Sensei's](https://senseis.xmp.net/?Atari)

**Dame** · Neutral points that belong to neither player. Empty intersections surrounded by both colors.
[Sensei's](https://senseis.xmp.net/?Dame)

**Joseki** · Established sequences of moves, usually in corners. Local equality through studied patterns.
[Sensei's](https://senseis.xmp.net/?Joseki)

**Ko** · A position where capture would recreate the previous board state. Forbidden to retake immediately.
[Sensei's](https://senseis.xmp.net/?Ko)

**Ladder** · A capturing sequence where a group is chased diagonally across the board.
[Sensei's](https://senseis.xmp.net/?Ladder)

**Liberty** · An empty point adjacent to a stone or group. Stones live by their liberties.
[Sensei's](https://senseis.xmp.net/?Liberty)

**Seki** · Mutual life. Two groups that cannot capture each other without dying first.
[Sensei's](https://senseis.xmp.net/?Seki)

**Snapback** · A sacrifice that enables immediate recapture of a larger group.
[Sensei's](https://senseis.xmp.net/?Snapback)

**Tenuki** · Playing elsewhere. Ignoring the local situation for a bigger point.
[Sensei's](https://senseis.xmp.net/?Tenuki)

**Tsumego** · Life and death problems. Reading exercises for tactical strength.
[Sensei's](https://senseis.xmp.net/?Tsumego)

## AI Terms

**Backpropagation** · The algorithm that teaches neural networks. Gradients flow backward, adjusting weights.
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation)

**MCTS** · Monte Carlo Tree Search. Build a tree through random sampling, then choose the most-visited path.
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search)

**Policy Network** · Predicts move probabilities. "Where would a strong player look?"
[AlphaGo Paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature16961)

**ResNet** · Residual Network. Skip connections that let gradients flow through deep networks.
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Residual_neural_network)

**UCB** · Upper Confidence Bound. Balances exploitation (known good moves) with exploration (untried moves).
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search#Exploration_and_exploitation)

**Value Network** · Predicts win probability from a position. "Who is winning here?"
[AlphaGo Paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature16961)

## Project Terms

**Ownership Head** · Auxiliary network output predicting final ownership of each board point.
[KataGo Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10565)

**Neurosymbolic** · Combining neural networks (pattern recognition) with symbolic reasoning (exact calculation).

**Feature Plane** · One channel of the neural network input. Each plane encodes one aspect of the board state.
